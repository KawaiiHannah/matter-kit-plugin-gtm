# Matter Kit - Google Tag Manager
**A plugin for including Google Tag Manager inside Matter Kit WordPress themes.**

## Installing the plugin
Install this plugin as you would other WordPress plugins, but uploading the directory to the plugins folder, or downloading the zip and uploading through the WordPress GUI.

## Setup
This works by adding a panel to the customiser with a field for the Google Tag Manager ID. Add the Google Tag Manager ID to the field and save your changes. 

The theme must include the hook 'mttr_page_setup' for the plugin to output the Tag Manager code. This should happen automatically within the core files of the new Matter Kit theme builds.
